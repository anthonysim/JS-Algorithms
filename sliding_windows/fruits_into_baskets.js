// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, 
// and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
